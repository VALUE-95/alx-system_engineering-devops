## More Information

### Shellcheck

Shellcheck is a tool to ensure proper Bash script writing. It offers recommendations on syntax and semantics, providing advice on edge cases. All Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any errors.

**Examples:**

_Not passing Shellcheck:_

```shell
# Your script content here
```

_Passing Shellcheck:_

```shell
# Your corrected script content here
```

For every feedback, Shellcheck will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue. For example, for code SC2034, you can browse [Shellcheck Wiki - SC2034](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2034).
