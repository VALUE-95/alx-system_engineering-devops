This prompt outlines a project on web server configuration and Bash scripting.

### Key Points:

* The project involves configuring a web server (`web-01`) on Ubuntu 16.04.
* You'll need to create a Bash script that automates the configuration steps.
* The script should not require manual intervention (e.g., using `emacs`).
* The focus is on automating repetitive tasks for efficient server management.

### Resources Provided:

* Learning materials on web servers, Nginx, HTTP, DNS, and child processes.
* References on HTTP standards (RFC 7231, RFC 7540) and commands like `scp`, `curl`.

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand the core functions of a web server.
* Explain the concept of child processes and their role in web servers.
* Identify common HTTP requests.
* Grasp the purpose and functionalities of DNS and its record types (A, CNAME, TXT, MX).

### Requirements:

* Use approved editors (vi, vim, emacs).
* Ensure scripts run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
* Include a newline character at the end of all files.
* Create a `README.md` file in the project directory.
* Make Bash scripts executable.
* Ensure scripts pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without errors.
* Start Bash scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
* Add a comment explaining the script's purpose as the second line.
* Avoid using `systemctl` for process restarts.

This project aims to enhance your automation skills in server management through web server configuration and Bash scripting. Remember, focus on creating an effective script that automates the required configuration tasks.
