## Project Understanding: SSH and Server Administration

This project seems to be an assessment for a DevOps or SysAdmin program. It focuses on using SSH with key-based authentication to connect to a remote Ubuntu server.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **Goal:**  Learn to connect to a remote server using SSH with key-based authentication, understand server basics, and script execution.
* **Timeline:** March 22nd, 2024 (6:00 AM) to March 25th, 2024 (6:00 AM).
* **Provided Resources:**  
    * A pre-configured Ubuntu server with your public key already installed.
    * Access to server information (IP and username) through the intranet's "my servers" section.
    * Various learning resources on servers, SSH, key-based authentication, and scripting. 
* **Learning Objectives:** By the end, you should be able to explain (without external help):
    * What a server is and where they reside.
    * What SSH is and its purpose.
    * Generating an SSH RSA key pair.
    * Connecting to a remote server using an SSH key pair.
    * The benefit of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for scripts.
* **Deliverables:**
    * A `README.md` file explaining the project.
    * Bash scripts (executable, starting with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`).
    * Your solutions should demonstrate understanding of the learning objectives. 
* **Restrictions:**
    * No plagiarism (copying others' work).
    * No publishing project content.
    * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    * Scripts must target Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and end with a new line.

## Next Steps:

1. **Review Resources:** Start by familiarizing yourself with the provided resources on servers, SSH, key-based authentication, and scripting (especially `#!/usr/bin/env bash`).
2. **Access Server Information:**  Log in to your intranet and locate the "my servers" section to find your server's IP address and username.
3. **Plan Your Scripts:**  Consider the learning objectives and brainstorm how you'll demonstrate them in your scripts. Maybe scripts to connect, check system info, etc. 
4. **Start Scripting:** Use the allowed editors (vi/vim/emacs) to write your scripts, following the project's requirements (header line, comments, etc.).
5. **Test and Document:** Thoroughly test your scripts and document them clearly in the `README.md` file.

This project offers a great opportunity to learn essential DevOps and SysAdmin skills. Utilize the resources, plan your approach, and remember to demonstrate your understanding through your scripts and documentation.
