# Processes and Signals Bash Project

## Overview

This Bash scripting project is designed to enhance your understanding of Linux processes, Process IDs (PIDs), and signals. The project consists of several tasks that require you to create Bash scripts to find, manage, and explain processes and signals.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Explain what a PID (Process ID) is and its significance.
2. Understand the concept of a process and how it operates in a Linux system.
3. Use various commands to find the PID of a specific process.
4. Terminate a process using the `kill` command.
5. Define what a signal is in the context of Linux processes.
6. Identify the two signals that cannot be ignored by a process.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Script for Finding Process PID

- **Script Name:** `find_pid.sh`
- **Description:** This Bash script takes a process name as an argument and outputs its corresponding PID.

### 2. Script for Killing a Process

- **Script Name:** `kill_process.sh`
- **Description:** Develop a Bash script that takes a PID as an argument and terminates the corresponding process.

### 3. Explanation Script

- **Script Name:** `explanation_script.sh`
- **Description:** This Bash script provides an explanation of PID, processes, and signals. It serves as a reference for understanding the key concepts covered in this project.
